# Web-Crawler
This is a basic Web Crawler for Wikipedia articles. The Crawler will move to the first link of the Wikipedia page (user input) and will keep on moving to a new page unless it finds a target url (user input) or returns to which it has encountered earlier. It will keep on outputting all the links to which it goes on during the whole process.
